# Sentiment Analysis using scikit-learn
In this project, we build a logistic regression model to classify movie reviews as either positive or negative. We will use the popular IMDB data set. Our goal is to use a simple logistic regression estimator from scikit-learn for document classification.
#### Tasks performed:
* Build and employ a logistic regression classifier using scikit-learn.
* Clean and pre-process text data.
* Perform feature extraction using nltk library.
* Tune model hyperparameters and evaluate model accuracy.
